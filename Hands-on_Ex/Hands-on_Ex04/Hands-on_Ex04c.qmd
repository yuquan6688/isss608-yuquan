# 1 Learning Outcome

Visualising uncertainty is relatively new in statistical graphics. In this chapter, we will gain hands-on experience on creating statistical graphics for visualising uncertainty. By the end of this chapter we will be able:

-   to plot statistics error bars by using ggplot2,

-   to plot interactive error bars by combining ggplot2, plotly and DT,

-   to create advanced by using ggdist, and

-   to create hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs) by using ungeviz package.

# 2 Getting Started

:::: panel-tabset
## Loading the packages

The following R packages will be used, they are:

-   tidyverse, a family of R packages for data science process,

-   plotly for creating interactive plot,

-   gganimate for creating animation plot,

-   DT for displaying interactive html table,

-   crosstalk for for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering), and

-   ggdist for visualising distribution and uncertainty.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(plotly, crosstalk, DT, 
               ggdist, ggridges, colorspace,
               gganimate, tidyverse)
```

## Import Data

Import The dataset for this hands-on exercise is imported into the R environment using the `read_csv()` function in the readr package and stored as the R object.

```{r}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

## Data Overview

::: panel-tabset
### summary()

```{r}
summary(exam)
```

### glimpse()

```{r}
glimpse(exam)
```

### head()

```{r}
head(exam,100)
```

# 3 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggplot2 methods
A point estimate is a single number, such as a mean. Uncertainty, on the other hand, is expressed as standard error, confidence interval, or credible interval.
